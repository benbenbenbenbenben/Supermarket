# Supermarket

Supermarket is a live repository for QA training, so you probably wouldn't want to rely on it for anything.

## What is this about? what is this????????

A supermarket chain needs software for the self-checkout machines.

The engineers at the supermarket have added some tests to ensure *Integration*. Our engineers will write tests and then implement the features to pass the tests.

The requirements we have so far, albeit limited, are as follow:

```
As a multisaver customer
When I buy 3 apples at £1 each
I expect to pay £2.50

As a multisaver customer
When I buy 4 apples at £1 each
I expect to pay £3.50

The Basket class will have functions to show:
SubTotal()
Total()
TotalSaved()
```

These requirements will be refined over time.

#### notes:

As a group we will work to 1. fix the failing tests, 2. implement the inconclusive tests, 3. write new tests as requirements/acceptance become known.
